# Algorithm_particle_detection_turbulent_flow

In turbulence, it is important to characterize the behaviour of small scales and their influences on the nature of the flow. The use of non-intrusive optical measurement techniques such as PTV makes it possible to capture all spatio-temporal scales in order to solidify current box turbulence models and to deepen knowledge of real turbulence. This technique requires the detetion of particle positions through a resolution of linear system reflecting the light intensity reflected by the illuminated particles in a flow slice. The following study aims to identify the most efficient algorithm in terms of computation time and robustness to detect these particles and to complete and continue research work on experimental characterization by PTV of a turbulence resulting from the interaction of turbulent jets.

The main document (in french, soon in english) is my internship report as part of my graduation in fluid mechanics. 
This internship was supervised by Jean-François KRAWCZYNSKI and Philippe DRUAULT of the "Institut Jean le Rond d'Alembert" laboratory of mechanics at Sorbonne Université, faculty of Science, Paris.
